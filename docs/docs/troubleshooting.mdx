### Fiesta Animations Blocking the UI

By default, the `Canvas` component has pointer events that block the UI. For the `Popper` component for example, the pointer events disabled by default to avoid this as the Fiesta components are not intended to have pointer events.
In case you are using an individual animation that doesn't have this property, you can disable it as below:

```tsx
<Canvas pointerEvents="none">
  <YourSkiaComponent />
</Canvas>
```
