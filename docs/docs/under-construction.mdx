### Components Roadmap

- ✅ Birthday Balloons (Twitter style)

- Words Splash
- Flowers
- Special days (e.g: May 5th or any other day)
- Halloween Pumpkins
- Lollipops
- Music Notes
- Party Poppers
- Button Celebrations
- Speed options for group animations (at least 3 default configs, slow, normal and fast)

### General Improvements

- More color themes
- Smoother Animations (improve the feel of the animations)
- Allow more configuration to all components in general. Sizes, colors, speed, radiuses, movements, e.t.c...
- Component to spread any component within the screen as for example the stars and hearts which works similar.

The library is very friendly for first-time contributors that enjoy building animations with JavaScript. Contributions are very welcome!
