Fiesta is a set of animations ideal for celebrations and user engagement.

As this library is fully powered by [@shopify/react-native-skia](https://github.com/shopify/react-native-skia), you will need to install it first. Please follow the installation in their [docs](https://shopify.github.io/react-native-skia/docs/getting-started/installation).

After that it is pretty simple:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="yarn"
  values={[{ label: "yarn", value: "yarn" }, { label: "npm", value: "npm" } ]}
>

<TabItem value="yarn">

```bash
yarn add @shopify/react-native-skia
yarn add react-native-fiesta
```

</TabItem>


<TabItem value="npm">

```bash
npm install @shopify/react-native-skia
npm install react-native-fiesta
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

No need to install any additional dependencies or pods.

🚧 This library is still under construction and it is experimental. Some API changes may happen. You can read more about it [here](../under-construction).
